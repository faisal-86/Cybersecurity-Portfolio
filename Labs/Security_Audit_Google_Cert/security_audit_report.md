## üìù Recommendations to IT Manager

1. **Implement Access Controls & Least Privilege**
   - Restrict access to sensitive data (e.g., PII, cardholder info) based on job role.
   - Apply separation of duties to reduce internal risk.

2. **Deploy Encryption**
   - Encrypt all stored and transmitted credit card and customer data to comply with PCI DSS and GDPR.

3. **Create a Disaster Recovery & Backup Strategy**
   - Define and test a disaster recovery plan with scheduled automated backups of critical systems.

4. **Upgrade Password Policies & Management**
   - Enforce strong password complexity.
   - Deploy a centralized password management system.

5. **Install IDS/IPS Systems**
   - Deploy an intrusion detection/prevention system to monitor for malicious activity.

6. **Regularly Maintain and Monitor Legacy Systems**
7. **Begin SOC Readiness and PCI/GDPR Compliance Initiatives**

## üß† Key Findings

- No formal access control or user account management policies
- No MFA, leaving admin accounts vulnerable to brute force attacks
- Backups exist but are neither encrypted nor regularly tested
- Company may be non-compliant with GDPR and PCI DSS regulations
